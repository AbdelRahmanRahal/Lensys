# Lensys
Lensys is a Google Chrome extension that converts selected text into code blocks with syntax highlight. Lensys is powered by [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) and supports most major languages. More features are in the works. Let me know if there are any thing you would like to see or if there are any bugs you come by as I am new to web dev.

# Usage
1. Select a piece of unformatted code.
2. Click on the Lensys icon.
3. Click on the `Lensys.syntaxHighlight(my_code);` button.

Done. The code should now be formatted into a beautiful code block with syntax highlighting for the lanugage used.
