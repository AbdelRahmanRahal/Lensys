# Lensys
Lensys is a Google Chrome extension that converts selected text into code blocks with syntax highlight. Lensys is powered by [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) and supports most major languages. More features are in the works. Let me know if there are any thing you would like to see or if there are any bugs you come by as I am new to web dev.

# Installation
Currently, this extension is not available on the Chrome store. So follow these steps to install it:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open up Google Chrome and click on the extensions icon.
3. Click on `Manage extensions`.
4. On the top left corner, click on `Load unpacked`.
5. Navigate to where you downloaded Lensys and click on the folder named `src` and click `open folder`.

Done. Now, you should be ready to use Lensys.

> **Warning**: this extension is not completed and published properly. In other words, every time an update happens, you will have to repeat this same process; it won't auto-update.

# Usage
1. Select a piece of unformatted code.
2. Click on the Lensys icon.
3. Click on the `Lensys.syntaxHighlight(my_code);` button.

Done. The code should now be formatted into a beautiful code block with syntax highlighting for the lanugage used.
